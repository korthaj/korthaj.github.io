<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The aim of this text is to explore API design and try to find
strategies and rules that can help us create code libraries
that are safe, effective and easy to use.</p>

<p>The text comes with three example libraries:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/yourbasic/fenwick">fenwick</a> is a tiny example intended to illustrate
the points in the first chapter.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/yourbasic/bloom">bloom</a> is a more intricate example with tricky semantics,
performance and compatibility issues.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/yourbasic/graph">graph</a> is a full-scale library with challenging
design decisions leading to new interfaces, complementary and
auxiliary data structures and subpackages.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most examples are in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)">Go</a>, the language itself being
a case study of good API design, with clean and simple
interfaces on top of a huge complex implementation.
There are also a few examples in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>, a language
that has had more time to accumulate crud in the form of
superfluous and dysfunctional elements.</p>

<p>The <code>go</code> keyword is particularly striking: the syntax couldn&rsquo;t
be simpler and the semantics are defined in
<a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Go_statements">eight lines of text</a>
in the language specification. Still, you rarely hear complaints
about thread support being limited in Go.</p>

<p>Garbage collection in Go is another impeccable example.
The implementation is hideously complicated, while the API
is minimal: there is no syntax and the language specification
doesn&rsquo;t even mention the concept explicitly. The runtime library
offers a single GC tuning parameter and plenty of memory statistics
for those who need it, but mostly it just works.</p>

<p>Even though API design is as much an art as a science, there still
are some fundamental rules that you should be aware of. Rules that
will cost you dearly if you break them. That&rsquo;s why the first chapter
is called <strong>The 5 Commandments</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-5-commandments">The 5 Commandments</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the basics. The rules never to be broken.
The rules that we don&rsquo;t need to argue about,
but that we still need to be reminded of.</p>

<p><img src="/algorithms/law.jpg" alt="law" /></p>

<!-- More kitsch from [Pixabay][pixabaylaw], [CC0 1.0][CC0]. -->

<h3 id="1-tell-me-what-this-thing-is">1. Tell me what this thing is</h3>

<blockquote class="math">
A software repository should have a <code>README</code> file,
and this file should say what the project <b>is about</b>.
Preferably in the very first sentence.
</blockquote>

<p>If people don&rsquo;t know what it is, they can&rsquo;t use it, duh.
Still, it&rsquo;s not uncommon to see a <code>README</code> file that starts with
&ldquo;Candide now supports the Pangloss 3.2 file format&rdquo;,
but never tells what Candide is and what it has to offer.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/yourbasic/fenwick">fenwick repo</a> I stick my neck out and try to
implement a small library that follows the rules in this chapter.
Its <code>README</code> file starts like this.</p>

<pre><code># Your basic Fenwick tree

### Golang list data structure supporting prefix sums

A Fenwick tree, or binary indexed tree, is a space-efficient
list data structure that can efficiently update elements and
calculate prefix sums in a list of numbers.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="2-tell-me-what-it-does">2. Tell me what it does</h3>

<blockquote class="math">
An API should say what the code <b>does</b>.
</blockquote>

<p>If a potential user gets past the <code>README</code> file, and dives into
the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/yourbasic/fenwick">Fenwick documentation</a>, she probably wants
the full story. Telling it three times is often a good approach.</p>

<p>First a short sentence stating the purpose of the package.</p>

<pre><code>Package fenwick provides a list data structure supporting prefix sums.
</code></pre>

<p>Then a slightly longer explanation.</p>

<pre><code>A Fenwick tree, or binary indexed tree, is a space-efficient
list data structure that can efficiently update elements and
calculate prefix sums in a list of numbers.
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, the nitty-gritty for those who want to know it all.</p>

<pre><code>Compared to a common array, a Fenwick tree achieves better
balance between element update and prefix sum calculation –
both operations run in O(log n) time – while using the same
amount of memory. This is achieved by representing the list
as an implicit tree, where the value of each node is the sum
of the numbers in that subtree.
</code></pre>

<h4 id="corollary">Corollary</h4>

<p>The 2nd Commandment comes with an obvious corollary.</p>

<blockquote class="math">
An API should say what <b>every exported function</b> does.
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, if you don&rsquo;t know what it does you can&rsquo;t use it, duh.
Undocumented functions are close to worthless. The only way to
use them safely is to perform a complete code review, including
necessary testing. That tends to be more work than writing
the &amp;$#! code yourself.</p>

<p>A descriptive function name is a good start, but only rarely does
the name tell the full story. And the full story is what we need.
In programming, there is no room for guesswork.</p>

<h3 id="3-don-t-tell-me-how-it-works">3. Don&rsquo;t tell me how it works</h3>

<blockquote class="math">
If at all possible, an API <b>shouldn't</b> reveal any implementation details.
</blockquote>

<p>Threading and garbage collection in Go are two examples of interfaces
that get this right. In general, a Go programmer doesn&rsquo;t have to,
and doesn&rsquo;t want to, worry about the intricacies of garbage collection
and threading. It just works.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/yourbasic/fenwick">fenwick repo</a> I didn&rsquo;t manage to fully hide the implementation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The data type is called <code>List</code>, not <code>Tree</code>. That&rsquo;s because it <strong>does</strong>
the job of a list, even though it&rsquo;s implemented as a tree.
I surely got that one right.</p></li>

<li><p>The cheesy stock photo in the <code>README</code> file depicts a list, not a tree.
Perhaps I got that right.</p></li>

<li><p>The data structure is known as a Fenwick tree, or binary indexed tree.
That wasn&rsquo;t my choice, but I&rsquo;m the one who included some implementation
details at the end of the package documentation. Sorry about that.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>However, the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/yourbasic/fenwick">documentation</a> of the <code>fenwick.List</code>data type and its methods
describes what the code does without telling anything about how it works.
This has two major benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>The library should be fairly easy to use. If you know what a list is,
you&rsquo;re ready to go.</li>
<li>There is plenty of room for improving and modifying the implementation
without breaking backwards compatibility.
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s a nice place to be in.</p>

<h3 id="4-grant-me-the-right-to-use-it">4. Grant me the right to use it</h3>

<blockquote class="math">
Every public software project needs a license.
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a lawyer and this is not legal advice, but it&rsquo;s my understanding
that code without a license can only be legally used by its own author.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for paying customers, you may want to seek
actual legal advice on licensing. However, to turn your project into
free and open-source software is easy: just put the proper
license text in the right places.</p>

<p>I like the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause">BSD 2-Clause License</a>. Not only does it offer
the permissions, conditions and limitations that I want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Permissions: private and commercial use, modification, distribution.</li>
<li>Conditions: license and copyright notice.</li>
<li>Limitations: liability and warranty.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s also easy to apply: you add a single file to the top
directory of your repo.</p>

<h3 id="5-don-t-change-it">5. Don&rsquo;t change it</h3>

<blockquote class="math">
A software library needs to be backwards compatible.
It's fine to improve the documentation, change the implementation,
and even introduce new features.
But if at all possible, <b>don't change the API</b>.
</blockquote>

<p>This is the tough one. There are two major challenges here:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you break this rule, you will break other people&rsquo;s code.</li>
<li>You need to get your API right at the very first attempt &ndash;
you may not be able to fix it later on.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to just follow this rule, you also need to say that
you are doing so. As a library provider you&rsquo;re in the business of trust.
This is why your library needs to explain its <strong>compatibility policy</strong>,
and why you should consider using <strong>semantic versioning</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="compatibility-policies">Compatibility policies</h4>

<p>Fenwick&rsquo;s compatibility policy is very simple, but still explicitly stated:</p>

<pre><code>### Roadmap

* The API of this library is frozen.
* Version numbers adhere to semantic versioning.

The only accepted reason to modify the API of this package
is to handle issues that can't be resolved in any other
reasonable way.
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1compat">Go 1 and the Future of Go Programs</a> is a full, detailed
compatibility document. It&rsquo;s required study for anyone working with
large-scale library design and maintenance.</p>

<p>For comparison, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8-compatibility-guide-2156366.html">Compatibility Guide for JDK 8</a> is
an entry point to the complex world of Java compatibility.</p>

<h4 id="semantic-versioning">Semantic versioning</h4>

<p><a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic versioning</a> is a convention for specifying compatibility
using a three-part version number: <code>major.minor.patch</code>. You increment</p>

<ul>
<li><code>major</code> when you make incompatible API changes,</li>
<li><code>minor</code> when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and</li>
<li><code>patch</code> when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The semantic versioning specification itself currently sits at version
number <code>2.0.0</code>. This means that it broke  The 5th Commandment,
and that no new features or patches have been introduced since then.
Even so, it&rsquo;s a good convention to follow. And, once again,
the Go project gets it right.</p>

<h2 id="keep-it-simple">Keep it simple</h2>

<p>Even though API design often requires us to make difficult trade-offs,
a simpler API is almost always a better API.</p>

<h3 id="don-t-use-complicated-constructs-where-simple-ones-will-do">Don&rsquo;t use complicated constructs where simple ones will do</h3>

<h4 id="functions">Functions</h4>

<p>A function is a simple and beautiful thing. It&rsquo;s easy to use,
easy to understand, easy to test, and it doesn&rsquo;t come with any
hidden side effects. And, perhaps most importantly, functions
can be freely composed. The better part of mathematics
is built from functions. If you can find a nice design using
functions only, good for you.</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;m talking about pure functions here, the ones that always produce
the same output given the same input; not the ones that output
the time of day or some other nasty surprise.)</p>

<h4 id="java-detour">Java detour</h4>

<p>The <code>static</code> keyword in Java has got a bad reputation. Probably because
it has so many different meanings. A static field is essentially a
global variable, and you typically want to avoid those.
A static method, however, is Java&rsquo;s way to declare a function,
as opposed to a method. This is a case where Java makes you jump
through hoops to do the right thing.</p>

<p>Functions are great also for Java programmers. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to use them.</p>

<h4 id="objects">Objects</h4>

<p>An object, or <code>struct</code> if you like, isn&rsquo;t quite as simple and
beautiful as a function, but it has memory. Many elegant and
powerful abstractions consist of a single object with a few
attached methods. The very best ones tend to be immutable.
At the core this is what object orientation is all about.
The rest is mostly bells and whistles.</p>

<h4 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h4>

<p>Inheritance and method overriding is pretty complicated.
Fortunately, <strong>interfaces</strong> and plain old <strong>composition</strong>
can typically get the job done in a simpler and safer way.</p>

<h4 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h4>

<p>Frameworks have steep learning curves and different frameworks
rarely play nice together. They are like dictators who can&rsquo;t
cooperate with others and who force you to do everything
according to their rules.</p>

<p>Unless you&rsquo;re building a new programming language, try to design
your API as a library rather than a framework. Don&rsquo;t ask the user
to subscribe to your philosophy and to follow your orders.
A good API should demand little and offer much.</p>

<h3 id="don-t-use-a-lot-where-a-little-will-do">Don&rsquo;t use a lot where a little will do</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>To paint a little thing like that you smeared<br />
Carelessly passing with your robes afloat, —<br />
Yet do much less, so much less, Someone says,<br />
(I know his name, no matter) — so much less!<br />
Well, less is more, Lucrezia: I am judged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>From Andrea del Sarto by Robert Browning, 1855.</em></p>

<p>Adding to Browning&rsquo;s advice would be a mistake. Instead, a war story:</p>

<p>The <code>java.io</code>, <code>java.nio</code>, <code>java.nio.channels</code>, <code>java.nio.channels.spi</code>,
<code>java.nio.file</code>, <code>java.nio.file.attribute</code>, <code>java.nio.file.spi</code>,
<code>java.nio.charset</code>,  and <code>java.nio.charset.spi</code> packages have many classes
and even more methods. In fact, the API is so overwhelming that many of us
end up at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> trying to move streams of bytes in and out
of our Java programs. Unfortunately, many of the friendly people who share
code snippets on Stack Overflow didn&rsquo;t read the full spec either,
and got it wrong.</p>

<p>For many years I didn&rsquo;t know that my Java programs used the platform
default character encoding. That&rsquo;s an ugly bug, and I&rsquo;m not the only one
to fall into this trap.</p>

<p>There probably is no way to design a really good general-purpose
IO library at this point. After all, such a library must support
low-level operations on many diverse platforms. But please, don&rsquo;t
add more fuel to the fire.</p>

<p>The Go <code>io</code> package is a fresh new start. The library takes some
getting used to, but it&rsquo;s small and manageable and handles common
use cases well. Unfortunately, no amount of API design can fully protect
us from the thorny history of file systems and fleeting memory technologies.</p>

<h3 id="one-package-one-idea">One package, one idea</h3>

<p>Chances are that you have never used the Java <code>Vector</code> class.
It was superseded by <code>ArrayList</code> already in Java 1.2.
The problem with <code>Vector</code> is that it does <strong>two things</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>it&rsquo;s a synchronized data structure, and</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s a list.</li>
</ol>

<p>Both of these things are very useful, but most of the time
you only want one of them.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with putting a lot of good stuff in you library.
The trick is to come up with suitable units
(classes or packages):</p>

<ul>
<li>units that do one well-specified thing,</li>
<li>are independent of each other, and</li>
<li>can be easily composed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="just-say-no">Just say no</h3>

<blockquote class="math">
An API shouldn't encourage bad design decisions.
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>add</code> method in Java&rsquo;s <code>ArrayList</code> is a case in point:</p>

<pre><code>public void add(int index, E element)

Inserts the specified element at the specified position
in this list. Shifts the element currently at that
position (if any) and any subsequent elements to the
right (adds one to their indices).
</code></pre>

<p>This method makes it easy to do the wrong thing. Adding a new element
to the middle of an array is really inefficient; something you should
typically avoid.</p>

<h3 id="math-is-simple">Math is simple</h3>

<blockquote>
If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only
because they do not realize how complicated life is.
<div class="quote-source"><em>John von Neumann</em></div>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can model your API on a mathematical abstraction,
such as a set or an interval, you&rsquo;re home free.
Mathematical abstractions tend to be atomic, well-specified,
independent, composable entities with a long story of use,
abuse and improvements along the way.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/yourbasic/graph/build#VertexSet">VertexSet</a>, a data structure for
specifying a group of vertices in a graph. There are three
mathematical abstractions here:</p>

<ul>
<li>the vertices themselves are identified by <strong>integers</strong>,</li>
<li>a group of vertices is a <strong>set</strong> with <strong>union</strong>, <strong>intersection</strong>,
<strong>set difference</strong> and <strong>membership</strong> operations, and</li>
<li>the constructor takes an <strong>interval</strong> as input.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two main reasons why I ended up with this API.
First, I believe that the included operations are useful,
necessary and sufficient. Secondly, they favor designs that
can be efficiently implemented in this particular package.</p>

<h2 id="give-it-time">Give it time</h2>

<p>The only certain way to know if an API works as intended
is to use it over an extended period of time on different
types of tasks and projects.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t rush it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus, I came to the conclusion that the <strong>designer</strong> of a new system
must not only be the <strong>implementor</strong> and the first <strong>large-scale user</strong>;
the designer should also <strong>write the first user manual</strong>. The separation
of any of these four components would have hurt TeX significantly.
If I had not participated fully in all these activities, literally
hundreds of improvements would never have been made, because I would
never have thought of them or perceived why they were important.</p>

<h2 id="show-don-t-tell">Show, don&rsquo;t tell</h2>

<p>Tutorials, examples and quick start guides are great tools for
improving an API.
The goal is to make it effortless to get started
and easy to perform common tasks.</p>

<h3 id="create-tutorials">Create tutorials</h3>

<p><a href="https:tour.golang.org">A Tour of Go</a> is a nice example of both a quick start and
a tutorial. It&rsquo;s an interactive online tutorial that let&rsquo;s you try
Go programming inside your browser without installing any software.</p>

<h3 id="use-examples">Use examples</h3>

<p>An example can demonstrate how an API is best used and
help clarify subtle points. This <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/yourbasic/bloom#example-package--Basics">Bloom filter example</a>
illustrates a typical Bloom filter use case, and it also helps clarify
the tricky semantics of a Bloom filter probabilistic membership test.</p>

<p>Once in a while, an example can fully replace a more standard API element.
Take a look this <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/yourbasic/graph#ex-package--DFS">DFS implementation example</a>, which shows how to implement
a depth-first search. Implementing DFS as a function with callbacks is
really messy. There are at least four different points in the code where
you may want to insert actions. Let&rsquo;s face it, occasionally cut and paste
is the better approach.</p>

<p>Grand ideas and theories aside, human artefacts
are built by combining the right bits and pieces.
This is a list of tried and trusted API building blocks.</p>

<h3 id="keep-it-consistent">Keep it consistent</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>si fueris Romae, Romano vivito more</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
In Java it&rsquo;s <code>toString</code>, <code>equals</code>, and <code>size</code>;
in Go it&rsquo;s <code>String</code>, <code>Equal</code>, and <code>Len</code>.
Suck it up, and get it right.</p>

<h3 id="write-functions-that-need-little-and-give-much">Write functions that need little and give much</h3>

<p>Java&rsquo;s <code>System.out.println</code> and Go&rsquo;s <code>fmt.Println</code> are real workhorses.
They&rsquo;ll take any input and offer lots of important information in return.
This is something we should strive for in our own API design.</p>

<h3 id="discover-a-well-fitting-interface">Discover a well-fitting interface</h3>

<p>The reason the print methods in Java and Go are so powerful
is not only that they take any input, they are also able
to handle that input in a sensible way.</p>

<p>In general, you want to find an interface that accepts everything
your code can handle; and little or nothing else.
This is typically very hard to do before you&rsquo;ve had a good helping
of your own dog food. That&rsquo;s why I like the Go approach.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You start by writing concrete code, and in the process
you discover interfaces that are increasingly accurate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/yourbasic/graph#Iterator">graph.Iterator</a> interface is the result of my longest search
for a well-fitting interface so far. I tried numerous graph data structures
and implemented even more graph algorithms before finding a proper fit.
There is no way I could have designed this up-front.</p>

<h3 id="make-it-generic">Make it generic</h3>

<p>A library based on a perfectly fitting interface is
a perfectly generic library.
Think about that.</p>

<h3 id="names-keep-them-short-and-sweet">Names, keep them short and sweet</h3>

<p>Short active verbs or verb phrases make for good function names,
even though I prefer to use <code>Name</code> rather than <code>GetName</code>.
The corresponding setter function, if needed, would still
be called <code>SetName</code>. Likewise, <code>Running</code> is a viable alternative
to <code>IsRunning</code>.</p>

<p>A pithy noun or noun phrase is often a fitting name for a constant,
a type, or a field of an object or a struct, considering that such names
often need to be recognized over longer stretches of code.</p>

<p>Here is a first-rate example from Go&rsquo;s aptly named <code>net/http</code> package.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// A Client is an HTTP client.
type Client struct {
	// Transport specifies the mechanism by which individual
	// HTTP requests are made.
	Transport RoundTripper

	// CheckRedirect specifies the policy for handling redirects.
	CheckRedirect func(req *Request, via []*Request) error

	// Jar specifies the cookie jar.
	Jar CookieJar

	// Timeout specifies a time limit for requests made
	// by this Client.
	Timeout time.Duration
}
</code></pre>

<p>When naming interfaces, we&rsquo;re obliged to do what the Roman&rsquo;s do.
In Java it&rsquo;s <code>Comparable</code> and <code>Serializable</code>; in Go it&rsquo;s <code>Reader</code>,
<code>Writer</code>, and even a <code>RoundTripper</code> home run.</p>

<p>For completeness, let&rsquo;s also discuss local variables and function arguments.
A short descriptive noun, such as <code>name</code>, <code>path</code> or <code>proc</code>, is often
a good choice here.</p>

<ul>
<li>For indices, <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, and <code>k</code> are universally used,</li>
<li>local integers are often known as <code>m</code> or <code>n</code>,</li>
<li>local floats might be <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, or <code>z</code>,</li>
<li>and local anonymous strings listen to the names <code>s</code> and <code>t</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a code snippet that follows these naming conventions.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">if proc.Running() &amp;&amp; proc.Name() != path {
	proc.SetName(path)
}
</code></pre>

<p>For comparison, here&rsquo;s a more verbose version of the same code.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">if process.IsRunning() &amp;&amp; process.GetProcessName() != pathName {
	process.SetProcessName(pathName)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Yikes.</p>
